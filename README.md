# TheBenefitsOfResponsiveDesign
This code compendium goes with the "The Benefits Of Responsive Design" section
of our "Launching an Internet Business"
(https://it4recruiters.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/developer-bootcamp). 

Class Description:
Use responsive design libraries like Bootstrap to simplify the amount of complex CSS necessary to render your site correctly on multiple devices.

Case Study:
This example continues building on our marketing site https://github.com/develpreneur/UsingCSSWithYourMarketingSite.  We start by including the Bootstrap CSS libraries and then replace most of our custom CSS with Bootstrap classes.
